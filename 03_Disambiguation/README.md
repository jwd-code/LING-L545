Constraint Grammar


I chose the second exercise for the morphological disambiguation practical. The sentence I chose to disambiguate in the text.txt file. The en-grammar.cg3 file contains the rules that I wrote. The output.txt file is the output from applying those rules. I ran this in the terminal as well as in the cg3ide. Lastly, I chose the en_ewt-ud-train.conllu  and the conllu analyser script to create the morphological analyser.
